Implementation of a smart contract lottery in solidity. Deployed with the brownie dev framework and uses true randomness with Chainlink

1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner
// Could make it DAO based over admin and use it for maybe giveaways in the hacker/skid DAO
